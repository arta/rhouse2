# 1) foreman is a manager for Procfile-based applications, which can be used to
# run multiple processes in your application at the same time
# 2) Remember to make this script executable with: `rhouse2 % chmod +x bin/dev`
#
# = foreman allows to run local server with `% ./bin/dev` instead of `% rails s`

if ! command -v foreman &> /dev/null
