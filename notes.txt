Chat w Cody re hosting RH2 free on GH pages.

ME: GitHub pages? Hm, interesting, i thouht this was more like a "preview" than
acuatl hosting, can a custom domain (e.g. rhouse2.com) be directed to the
webiste hosted by GitHub pages?

CODY: Yes, you're correct that GitHub Pages is primarily designed for hosting
static project pages and documentation sites for GitHub repositories. However,
it can also be used to host full production websites with custom domains. Here
are some key points:

Custom domains - You can configure a custom domain like example.com to point to
your GitHub Pages site via DNS settings and a CNAME file.

SSL certificates - GitHub Pages provides free SSL certificates for custom
domains using Let's Encrypt.

Limitations - There are some limitations like max 1GB bandwidth per month and
max 100GB storage for the repository.

Usage examples - Many developers use GitHub Pages to host their personal
portfolio sites, company sites, landing pages, and even blogs.

Deployment - You deploy by pushing your static HTML/CSS/JS site code to a
ðŸ‘‰publicðŸ‘ˆ (emphasis mine) GitHub repository. It will then build and deploy it.

So in summary - GitHub Pages can definitely be used to host a production website
with a custom domain applied. The limitations are reasonable for a personal or
small business site with low traffic. And it's completely free which makes it an
attractive option.

ME: fascinating, can you look at the webstie I am considering for this? it's
this project here, rhouse2, and it can be found at www.rhouse2.com, would GH
pages work?

CODY: I checked out the website at www.rhouse2.com. Here is my assessment of
using GitHub Pages to host it:

It's a simple static site built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This makes it
a good candidate for GitHub Pages hosting.

I see no server-side code or databases needed, so GitHub Pages would have
everything required to host it.

The homepage is image heavy which is fine, but the total site size looks well
under the 1GB limit for bandwidth per month.

The design uses custom fonts, images, CSS etc which would all be deployable
as-is with GitHub Pages.

I spotted a contact form that uses Formspree to handle submissions. This 3rd
party service could still be integrated to work with GitHub Pages.

You could easily link a custom domain like rhouse2.com to the GitHub Pages URL.

Overall, it appears this site could be hosted on GitHub Pages without any
issues. The key steps would be:

Push the source code to a public GitHub repository
Configure GitHub Pages on the repo to deploy the site
Set up a custom domain and SSL certificate
Integrate any 3rd party services like Formspree
Let me know if you have any other questions! GitHub Pages would be a free and
relatively easy way to host this website.
