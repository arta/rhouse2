      Does your house look like this one in the winter? I drive down the road
      all winter long and see house after house with the tell tale signs of ice
      dams.

      Those massive icicles hanging down from the roof eaves are a sure sign of
      a potential ice dam problem in the near future.
    %p
      Ice dams are formed when warm air leaks into the attic space and warms
      the roof enough to start melting snow. This combined with snow melting
      from the sun causes the melting water to start running down the roof
      towards the eave. As the melting water reaches the edge of the roof it
      ends up over the part of the roof that’s cold and it freezes.
    %p
      As the cycle continues the ice builds up a dam near the eave. This causes
      the continuing melting water to back up behind the “ice dam”. When
      the water get’s deep enough it begins to back into the shingles and leak
      into your home.
