  %h2 Tired of Unwanted Pests Damaging Your Home?

  %p
    One of the first things people notice when they have bats is a rustling
    noise in their walls or ceiling. Once a bat makes its way into the house or
    leaves a disgusting mess in the attic, they've usually had enough and call
    us. Find out how we go about getting rid of bats and keeping them out.

  %p
    Getting rid of bats actually involves two steps: bat removal and bat
    exclusion. This means we install equipment that works with the bats' natural
    habits to get them out of your house (the bat removal part). That same
    equipment works to prevent them from re-entering your home once they've gone
    (bat exclusion). Whether you have two bats flying through your child's
    bedroom at night or a colony of 200 in your attic, our bat removal and
    exclusion services will work to get rid of bats and keep them away
    permanently.

  %p
    Bats create large roosting colonies inside the roofs of exposed buildings.
    The bats leave mass amounts of droppings which are unpleasant in odor and
    appearance, but more importantly are a major source of the respiratory
    disease histoplamosis. Bat removal involves carefully inspecting a building
    to find how the animals are using it and then setting up an exclusion
    system. Bats are not killed, exterminated, or trapped in this process ...

    %h3 Bat Facts

    %p
      While 99% of all bats are rabies free, they still rank in the number three
      position behind raccoons and skunks for giving human beings rabies. It has
      been reported that during the past 20 years, there have been more human
      rabies cases that began with a bat bite in the United States than of any
      other wildlife group.
