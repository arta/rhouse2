  %h1 Green Roofs

  %p
    Centuries old, the roof garden concept has been most recently embraced in
    the United States. Both functional and aesthetically-appealing, this
    technology improves the structure's energy efficiency while adding plant
    life in populated areas.

  %p
    Currently, the focus on improving the quality of life in urban environments
    has made these issues more pertinent than ever. Roof Gardens meet
    the objectives of many of the mandates to improve the air quality of cities
    by mitigating the effects of heat islands caused by ever increasing
    development. The benefits of the modern Roof Garden have been demonstrated
    by the US Green Building Council's endorsement of these systems through
    the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification
    program.

    At #{rh2}, we use Carlisle's Roof Garden System which provide a variety of
    waterproofing options with a full line of accessories to insure a high
    performance system.

    Buildings and hardscape surfaces make cities into giant, heat absorbing
    sinks, creating an "Urban Heat Island Effect" which contributes to air
    pollution, increased energy usage and heat-related illnesses. Lack of green
    space in cities means rainwater runoff carries contaminants from rooftops
    into our waterways, often releasing untreated sewage with it.

  %p
    That's why we are committed to accelerating the installation of green roofs,
    lightweight roofing systems that support vegetation.
